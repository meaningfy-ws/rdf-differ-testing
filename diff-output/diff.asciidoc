|Approach whereby Buyers seek to procure by fulfilling social objectives. Additional Information: Socially Responsible Public Procurement (SRPP) - ‘SRPP’ means Procurement Operations that take into account one or more of the following social considerations: employment opportunities, decent work, compliance with social and labour rights, social inclusion (including persons with disabilities), equal opportunities, accessibility design for all, taking account of sustainability criteria, including ethical trade issues and wider voluntary compliance with corporate social responsibility (CSR), while observing the principles enshrined in the Treaty for the European Union (TFEU) and the Procurement Directives.

|Statistical data on the Procedure and the Lot. Additional Information At the present time Procurement Procedures are not fully electronic. At a later date, information on the Tenders received could be inferred by the data in the eProcurement System. Therefore this class is temporal and should cease to exist in fully electronic Procurement. The need for its presence responds also to the alignment with the Regulation (EU) 2019/1780 (eForms). Attention will have to be paid in the future to possible inconsistencies derived from data placed in other classes and data held in the Statistical Information class; e.g. the TenderEvaluation class (see eEvaluation diagram) has the attribute admissibileTender indicator, which in case of being false, may enter in contradiction with the highest or lowest Tender value for that very same inadmissible Tender.
